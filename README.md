How To Play:

W to Jump

D to Shoot

On game over, Left Mouse Button to Restart

Remark: Not too sure what the bug is but there seems to be some undefined behaviour going on when restarting the game,
it sometimes works, sometimes freezes the game, and rarely, the code segfaults.

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
